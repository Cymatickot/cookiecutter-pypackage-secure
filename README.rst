Cookiecutter PyPackage Secure Idea
===================================

A security-oriented, modernized fork of the original `cookiecutter-pypackage` template—  
intended as **an open-source effort to move toward** alignment with software assurance practices drawn from:

* 🛡️ **NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)**
* 📘 **NIS2 Directive Article 21**
* 🛰️ **SLSA Level 3 (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts)**
* 📦 **SBOM and signing readiness**

**⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️⚠️🔥️**

This project is **experimental**, **non-certified**, and **does not constitute compliance**  
with any official regulatory framework or assurance level. It is offered **as a base** for hardening and extension.
